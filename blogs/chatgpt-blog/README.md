# Blog - Ansible and ChatGPT: Putting it to the test

## Overview

In this blog, we wanted to put ChatGPT to the test and see how it fares with developing  Ansible Playbooks and share our results.

We asked ChatGPT to generate a [playbook](playbooks/ec2_instances_orig.yml). This playbook needed [amendments](playbooks/ec2_instances_fixed.yml) to work correctly using supported Ansible versions and best practices.
